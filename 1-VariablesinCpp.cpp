Variables in C++

It's the compiler who can tell how much memory it's gonna store for a certain type of variable like int and from that depends which numbers you can store inside that variable.

int 4 Bytes; from -2 bilion to + 2 bilion

unsigned int 4 Byte

char 1 B

short 2 B

long 4 B

long long 8 B

char a = 65; a=A
char a = "A"; a=A

float 4 B

float n = 5.5; n Ã¨ cmq un double per costringerlo a float
float n = 5.5f; 'f' o 'F' e' indifferente

double 8 B

bool 1 B it can be false, true, 0 or any other number different from 0 to say true

sizeof(bool) -> return the size of the type

POINTERS add an asterisc after the data type like -> bool*
REFERENCES -> bool&
