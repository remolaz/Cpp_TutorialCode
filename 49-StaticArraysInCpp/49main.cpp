	Static array and the old style arrays are both allocated in the STACK.
	The memory accupied is the same. The static array doesn't have a memory allocated
	variable for size, there is just the number 5 allocated as in the old style C++ array.
	So the memory occupied by the two array version is the same.

	Over the two is better to use the Static array because it has the same performances of the old style
	array but then it keeps also track of the size.
